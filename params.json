{"name":"Starchaser","tagline":"Udacity Project 3: Frogger Arcade Game Clone","body":"Welcome to Starchaser!\r\n======================\r\nThis is my Frogger arcade game clone for the Udacity Front-End Web Development nanodegree.\r\n\r\nTo run the game\r\n---------------\r\nPlease go to [my GitHub page](http://lagracia.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/ \"Starchaser Arcade Game Clone\") and enjoy the game :)\r\n\r\nTo play the game\r\n----------------\r\n- Use the arrow keys to move the player up, down, left and right.\r\n- Player starts with extra 3 lives and loses 1 if she runs into a bug.\r\n- When your player has no lives remaining, she can get an extra life if your score is divisible by 15.\r\n\r\nScoring\r\n-------\r\n- Get 5 points per star. Collect a star by moving to its square.\r\n- Get 10 points every time the player reaches the water.\r\n- Whenever your player gets an extra life, you get 5 bonus points.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\nHaving absolutely zero programming background, I needed the step-by-step explanations given in the discussion thread “A Study in JavaScript: Provided Code for the Game Clone,” written by Udayan. The post explained the engine and resources JS files very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, I just couldn't figure out app.js on my own. So I copied from students who had posted their project repositories on GitHub and shared the links in the forum. Many thanks to danielmoi, morapost, andrewlw89, jyothisridhar, ayimaster, lacyjpr and joseterrera.\r\n\r\nOnce I meet the code reviewers' expectations for this project, I will pay it forward by sharing my work too, in case someone can learn from it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
